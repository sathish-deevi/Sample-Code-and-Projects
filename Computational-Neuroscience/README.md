Section for Computational Neuroscience work.

# Table of Contents

## 1. Nonparametric and Clustering Techniques for ISLES.

This folder contains work and data for a presentation entitled “A look at nonparametric & clustering techniques applied to computational neuroimaging modalities in high dimensional space with spatiotemporal cross-correlated voxel sets.”
I presented this to the Clinical Brain Imaging Working Group of the Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute in November 2015.

## (2. posted after publication)

## 3. Deep Learning methods for ISLES.
This folder contains work and data that applied some deep learning techniques to ISLES data.
