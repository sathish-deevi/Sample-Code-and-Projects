<p>Based on the advice of many data scientists I've spoken to, I'm slowly pushing out some of my projects to be Github. This will serve as the main page to hold and explain what I've done and how you can use/reuse the code and data.</p>

<p>I'm currently pushing out some work I've done in the Quantitative Law space, but until that is complete you may wish to take a look at the modes and roads packages that I've been working on in R. Modes is completed and available on CRAN at <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/modes/index.html">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/modes/index.html</a> or Github at <a href="http://sathish-deevi.github.io/modes-Package/">http://sathish-deevi.github.io/modes-Package/</a>. Roads is still in development, but you can see the Github page at <a href="http://sathish-deevi.github.io/Roads-Package">http://sathish-deevi.github.io/Roads-Package</a>.</p>

<p>Modes:
An R package to calculate the mode or compute a certain number of modes if there are numerous modes and antimodes. The use of this package is actually more focused on assessing modality and clusters, but since I had written a few different functions over time to calculate the mode or modes and I never found something super easy to use--I thought I would combine a few and do that as well. </p>

  *I plan to eventually migrate this over to Github.</p>
