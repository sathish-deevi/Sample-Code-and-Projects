## Key Variables

### 1) Combined Score

The combined-score is a composite of each journal's impact-factor and total cites count. The combined-score is, by default, weighted with approximately a third of the weight given to impact-factor and two-thirds given to total cites. The resulting score is then normalized.
The formula for obtaining the combined-score is the addition of the weighted and normalized scores for each of impact-factor (IF) and total cites (TC):
  ((IF x weight x 100)/highest-IF)   +   ((TC x (1-weight) x 100)/highest-TC)


### 2) Impact Factor

Impact-factor shows the average number of annual citations to articles in each journal (rounded to two decimal places). Impact-factor rankings should be used cautiously as they are biased against journals that publish a larger number of shorter articles, such as book reviews. 

### 3) Journal Cites

The number of citations in journals.

### 4) Currency Factor

Currency-factor aims to compare journals on how rapidly their articles become cited.

### 5) Case Cites

The number of citations in case law.

### 6) Cites/Cost

The Cites per Cost ranking is the average yearly number of cites to the journal divided by the annual US$ cost to U.S. academic libraries. So e.g., a journal with 600 cites per annum and costing $60 would show '10' in the Cites per Cost column.
