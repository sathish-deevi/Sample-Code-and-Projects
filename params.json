This will serve as the main page to hold and explain what I've done and how you can use/reuse the code and data.\r\n\r\nI'm currently pushing out some work I've done in the Quantitative Law space, but until that is complete you may wish to take a look at the modes and roads packages that I've been working on in R. Modes is completed and available on CRAN at <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/modes/index.html> or Github at <http://sathish-deevi.github.io/modes-Package/>. Roads is still in development, but you can see the Github page at <http://sathish-deevi.github.io/Roads-Package>.\r\n\r\nModes:\r\nAn R package to calculate the mode or compute a certain number of modes if there are numerous modes and antimodes. The use of this package is actually more focused on assessing modality and clusters, but since I had written a few different functions over time to calculate the mode or modes and I never found something super easy to use--I thought I would combine a few and do that as well. \r\n\r\nSome Links:\r\nCRAN package repository for R modes package: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/modes/>\r\nReference manual for modes package in R: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/modes/modes.pdf>\r\nPersonal website (for bugs*, comments, etc.): <http://www.sdeevi.com/modes_package>\r\n  *I plan to eventually migrate this over to Github.\r\n\r\n\r\n Roads\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
